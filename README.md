# RSA_Encryption_with_Steganography

Steganography and Cryptography are two popular ways of sending vital
information in a secret way. One hides the existence of the message and the
other distorts the message itself. This project implements the advanced LSB
(least significant bit) and RSA algorithm to make the message highly secure. By
matching data to an image, there is less chance of an attacker being able to use
stego analysis to recover data. Before hiding the data in an image, the
application first encrypts it.
